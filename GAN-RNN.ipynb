    "My objevtive for the machine learning project is to create a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that can generate (somewhat) legible poetry based on a collection of poems. To do so, I will clean the data and cut up groups of words into sets of inputs for the network to take. The size of the input i.e. the number of words is yet to be determined considering we want to have a large enough input size to gather important features like rhyme schemes and context for the LSTM cell to remember, but we don't want to be too large in our input size that training is too slow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of feeding in actual words, I will encode each word into an identifier, making the unique set of these identifiers as the Y vector for our supervised learning to take place. The vocabulary vector, our Y vector, will be one hot encoded for the word that was actually present, which the LSTM cell will attempt at predicting for each time step. \n",
